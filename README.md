# Bootstrap Portfolio 

---

## Description 

My motivation for this project was to create a portfolio using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I built the project to show my skillset in Bootstrap and to showcase the projects I have worked on so far. With this portfolio, my work is easily accessible to future employers and colleagues. During my time building the portfolio, I was able to learn various skills within Bootstrap, for example, linking Bootstrap into the HTML, Bootstrap Docs, using various components: Navbar, Jumbotron, Cards, and Footers. Using Bootstrap styling to amend the HTML doc and many more.
